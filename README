Apache Chemistry DotCMIS 0.1
============================

Apache Chemistry DotCMIS is a Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS)
client library for the .NET framework 3.5 or higher.

See http://chemistry.apache.org/dotnet/dotcmis.html for more information.

See http://chemistry.apache.org/dotnet/getting-started-with-dotcmis.html for code samples
and DotCMISDoc.chm for the API documentation.


This is the very first release of DotCMIS. All CMIS operations and both bindings have 
been implemented. The API is complete and is not supposed to change in following releases. 
The most frequently used operations have been successfully tested against a small number 
of repositories from different vendors.

However, the current test coverage is not sufficient to identify all kinds of problems and
compatibility issues. The code base will be tested and improved in the following releases. 
If you find a problem, please let us know: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CMIS


Known stumbling blocks
----------------------

- The Web Services binding only works with HTTPS. The .NET framework does not allow calls
  with UsernameTokens over plain HTTP.

- Not all CMIS Web Services endpoints are compatible with the .NET framework for a number
  of reasons. Use the AtomPub binding if available. It's also faster.

  
Strong-Name signing
-------------------

The DLL included in this release is signed with a public/private key pair that is also 
included in this package. This allows you to deploy it to the global assembly cache (GAC) 
and to make changes to the DotCMIS source code without recompiling your application.
However, since the private key is publicly available, this strong name cannot be trusted.
If a trust relationship between your application and the DotCMIS DLL is important to you, 
you have to rebuild the DLL from the source code and sign it yourself.
