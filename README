Apache Chemistry DotCMIS 0.1
============================

Apache Chemistry DotCMIS is a Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS)
client library for the .NET framework 3.5 or higher.

See http://chemistry.apache.org/dotnet/dotcmis.html for more information.

See http://chemistry.apache.org/dotnet/getting-started-with-dotcmis.html for code samples.


This is the very first release of DotCMIS. All CMIS operations and both bindings have 
been implemented. The API is complete and is not supposed to change in following releases. 
The most frequently used operations have been successfully tested against a small number 
of repositories from different vendors.

However, the current test coverage is not sufficient to identify all kinds of problems and
compatibility issues. The code base will be tested and improved in the following releases. 
If you find a problem, please let us know: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CMIS


Known stumbling blocks
----------------------

- The Web Services binding only works with HTTPS. The .NET framework does not allow calls
  with UsernameTokens over plain HTTP.

- Not all CMIS Web Services endpoints are compatible with the .NET framework for a number
  of reasons. Use the AtomPub binding if available. It's also faster.
